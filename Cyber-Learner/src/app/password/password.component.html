        <p>
            A Password is a word, phrase, or string of characters intended to differentiate an authorized 
            user or process (for the purpose of permitting access) from an unauthorized user, or put another 
            way, a password is used to prove one's identity or authorize access to a resource. It's strongly 
            implied that a password is secret. A password is usually paired with a username or other mechanism 
            to provide authentication.
