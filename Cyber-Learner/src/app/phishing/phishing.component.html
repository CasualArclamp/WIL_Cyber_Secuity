        <h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
        
        <b>
        <p>
            Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which one or more targets are contacted by email,
            phone, or text message by someone pretending to be a legitimate authority to lure individuals
            into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information,
            bank and credit card details, and passwords.

        <h3>Common features of Phishing Emails</h3>
        
        <b>
        <li>1. Deceptive Sender Address: Phishing emails may display a sender address that appears legitimate at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it may contain slight misspellings, unusual domains, or random characters.</li>
        <li>2. Generic Greetings or No Personalization: Phishing emails often use generic greetings like "Dear Customer" or do not address the recipient by name. Legitimate organizations typically use personalized greetings.</li>
        <li>3. Urgent or Threatening Language: Phishing emails may create a sense of urgency or use threatening language to pressure recipients into taking immediate action, such as claiming an account will be suspended.</li>
        <li>4. Spelling and Grammatical Errors: Phishing emails may contain noticeable spelling and grammatical mistakes, which are less likely to be present in communications from reputable organizations.</li>
        <li>5. Mismatched URLs: Hovering over hyperlinks in a phishing email may reveal that the displayed link does not match the actual destination. Attackers often use disguised URLs to redirect victims to malicious websites.</li>
        <li>6. Request for Personal Information: Phishing emails commonly request sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or account credentials, which legitimate organizations typically do not request via email.</li>
        <li>7. Attachments or Suspicious Links: Phishing emails may contain attachments or links that, if opened or clicked, could download malware or lead to a fake website designed to steal information.</li>
        <li>8. Unusual Sender Behavior: The sender's behavior may be suspicious, such as unexpected requests for sensitive information, unusual language, or communication outside of normal channels.</li>
        <li>9. Unsolicited Attachments: Phishing emails may include unsolicited attachments, especially those with file types commonly associated with malware (e.g., .exe, .zip).</li>
        <li>10. Misspelled Brand Names: Cybercriminals often impersonate well-known brands or organizations but may misspell the name slightly, which can be a telltale sign of a phishing attempt</li>

        <h3>How to prevent Phishing attacks?</h3>

        <b>
        <p>Verify Sender Information:</p>
        <p id="details">Always double-check the sender's email address, especially if the message contains suspicious content or requests.</p>

        <p>Do Not Click on Suspicious Links:</p>
        <p id="details">Hover over links to view the actual URL before clicking. Be cautious of shortened URLs or URLs that seem unrelated to the content of the message.</p>

        <p>Be Skeptical of Urgency:</p>
        <p id="details">Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency. If you receive a message pressuring you to act quickly, take extra precautions to verify its legitimacy.</p>

        <p>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</p>
        <p id="details">Enable MFA whenever possible for your accounts. This provides an additional layer of security even if your password is compromised.</p>

        <p>Keep Software Updated:</p>
        <p id="details">Regularly update your operating system, applications, and security software to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.</p>

        <p>Install and Use Security Software:</p>
        <p id="details">Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software to help detect and prevent phishing attacks.</p>

        <p>Beware of Pop-Up Windows:</p>
        <p id="details">Avoid clicking on pop-up windows or dialog boxes in emails, especially if they ask for personal information.</p>

        <p>Guard Personal Information:</p>
        <p id="details">Never provide sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or financial details in response to unsolicited messages.</p>

        <p>Verify Requests for Payment or Sensitive Data:</p>
        <p id="details">If you receive a request for payment or sensitive information, verify it through a separate communication channel (e.g., a phone call) before taking any action.</p>

        <p>Enable Spam Filters:</p>
        <p id="details">Use email services with strong spam filters to help identify and quarantine phishing emails.</p>

        <p>Report Suspected Phishing Attacks:</p>
        <p id="details">If you receive a suspected phishing email, report it to your email provider and to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (<a href="reportphishing@apwg.org">reportphishing@apwg.org</a>).</p>

        <p>Monitor Accounts Regularly:</p>
        <p id="details">Keep a close eye on your financial accounts, social media, and email accounts for any unusual activity.</p>
