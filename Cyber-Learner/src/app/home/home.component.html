				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p><b>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, 
					mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. 
					It is also known as information technology security or electronic information security. 
					The term applies to a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, 
					and can be divided into several common categories.</b></p>

					<h3>Why does cybercrime exist?</h3>
					
					<b>
					<p>
						Cybercrime exists due to a combination of factors that 
						exploit the opportunities presented by the digital age. 
						The interconnectedness of the internet and the vast amount 
						of valuable data stored online create an enticing landscape 
						for criminals. Motivations range from financial gain and 
						ideological agendas to personal vendettas or simply the thrill 
						of illicit activity. The relative anonymity provided by the 
						digital realm allows cybercriminals to operate with reduced 
						fear of immediate repercussions, often evading traditional 
						law enforcement methods. Additionally, the rapid evolution 
						of technology sometimes outpaces security measures, leaving 
						vulnerabilities that cybercriminals exploit for their advantage. 
						As long as these conditions persist, cybercrime will continue 
						to pose a significant threat in our increasingly digitized world.

				<h2>The benefits of following cyber security best practices:</h2>
				<b>
					<li>
						Protection Against Cyber Threats: Implementing best practices 
						helps defend against a wide range of cyber threats such as 
						viruses, malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks.
					</li>

					<li>
						Safeguarding Sensitive Data: It ensures the security and 
						confidentiality of sensitive information, including personal 
						data, financial records, and intellectual property.
					</li>

					<li>
						Prevention of Financial Losses: Effective cybersecurity measures 
						reduce the risk of financial losses due to data breaches, legal 
						penalties, and costs associated with resolving security incidents.
					</li>

					<li>
						Staying Ahead of Evolving Threats: Regularly updating and improving 
						security measures helps organizations stay ahead of emerging 
						threats, which are constantly evolving.
					</li>

				<h2>The description for Network Security:</h2>
				<b>
					<p>
						Network security refers to the practice of safeguarding a computer 
						network infrastructure from unauthorized access, disruption, misuse, 
						or modification. It involves the implementation of various technologies, 
						policies, and procedures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and 
						availability of data and resources within a network.
					</p>

					<p>Key components of network security include:</p>

					<li>
						Access Control: This involves regulating who can access the network 
						and what resources they can use. It includes user authentication, 
						authorization, and accounting.
					</li>

					<li>
						Firewalls: Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal 
						network and untrusted external networks (like the internet). They 
						filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on an applied rule set.
					</li>

					<li>
						Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): IPS systems monitor network and/or 
						system activities for malicious or unwanted behavior and can react, in 
						real-time, to block or prevent those activities.
					</li>

					<li>
						Antivirus and Antimalware Software: These programs are designed to detect, 
						prevent, and remove malicious software (viruses, worms, trojans, etc.) from 
						entering and causing harm to a network.
					</li>

					<li>
						Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs allow secure communication over the internet 
						by creating a private network from a public internet connection. This enables 
						users to send and receive data securely over a public network.
					</li>

					<li>
						Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent 
						unauthorized access. It ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be 
						read without the proper decryption key.
					</li>
				</b>

			<section id="application">
				
				<h2>The description for Application Security:</h2>
				<b>
					<p>
						Application security refers to the measures and practices taken to protect software 
						applications from threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. It involves implementing 
						security controls and best practices throughout the entire software development 
						lifecycle to ensure that applications are secure, reliable, and resistant to 
						unauthorized access or manipulation.
					</p>

					<p>Key components of application security include:</p>

					<li>
						Input Validation: Ensuring that data entered into an application is validated 
						to prevent malicious input (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) from 
						causing harm.
					</li>

					<li>
						Authentication and Authorization: Implementing mechanisms to verify the identity 
						of users and control their access to various parts of the application.
					</li>

					<li>
						Session Management: Managing user sessions securely to prevent session hijacking 
						or session fixation attacks.
					</li>

					<li>
						Data Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data in storage and during transmission 
						to protect it from unauthorized access or interception.
					</li>

					<li>
						Error Handling and Logging: Properly handling errors and logging security-related 
						events to monitor and respond to suspicious activities.
					</li>

					<li>
						Secure Coding Practices: Following best practices for writing secure code, including 
						avoiding common vulnerabilities and adhering to secure coding standards.
					</li>

					<li>
						Secure File Uploads: Implementing controls to prevent malicious files from being 
						uploaded and executed on a server.
					</li>

					<li>
						Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Implementing measures to prevent 
						attackers from tricking users into performing unintended actions on a web application.
					</li>

					<li>
						Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Controlling which domains are allowed to 
						access resources on a web page to prevent unauthorized data access.
					</li>

			<h2>The description for Information Security:</h2>
			<b>
				<p>
					Information security, often abbreviated as InfoSec, refers to the practice of protecting 
					information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. It encompasses 
					a range of strategies, technologies, and processes designed to safeguard sensitive data, 
					whether in digital or physical form.
				</p>

				<p>Key components of information security include:</p>

				<li>
					Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is only accessible to those who 
					have the proper authorization and need to know.
				</li>

				<li>
					Integrity: Guaranteeing the accuracy and reliability of information by 
					preventing unauthorized alterations.
				</li>

				<li>
					Availability: Ensuring that information and resources are available and 
					accessible to authorized users when needed.
				</li>

				<li>
					Authentication: Verifying the identity of users, systems, or devices 
					attempting to access information or resources.
				</li>

				<li>
					Authorization: Granting specific permissions and privileges to authenticated 
					users based on their roles and responsibilities.
				</li>

				<li>
					Non-repudiation: Ensuring that actions or transactions cannot be denied by 
					the parties involved, providing accountability.
				</li>
